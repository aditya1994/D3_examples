# Example of D3: Enter-Update-Exit pattern

The goal of this project is to internalize the d3 enter-update-exit pattern. You'll be creating two visualizations: A flow diagram (which graphically illustrates the enter-update-exit pattern), and a scatter plot (to dynamically display data). 


# How to run

1. Clone the repo.
2. In the terminal: cd d3_pattern && http-server 
3. Go to localhost:8080
